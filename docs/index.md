<h2><u>Introduction</u></h3>
<p>
  The project is intended to stop the piracy of the software application, a methodology is embedded inside
  the software application, which is required to be protected from piracy. This methodology includes
  using of authentication server for license key authorization, and the registration of the license key with
  the corresponding MAC address. The methodology makes use of the Authentication server checks and
  registers the software application, even in the offline mode this methodology works well and does not
  allow any counterfeit copy of the software application to run on any other computer. Authentication
  and registration of the software application are done only during the installation of the software
  application. Once the installation is successful then the MAC address is used for offline authentication
  so that its counterfeit copy cannot run on any other computer.
</p>
<h2><u>How it Works</u></h3>
<p>
The proposed methodology can be embedded into any software application in order to prevent it from
being pirated, it works in the following way:-
During the installation time, the software installer requires an active internet connection for complete
successful installation of the software into the machine.
When the genuine license key goes into the software application, the application feeds that license
key to the Authentication Program and after that, the key again fed to the MD5 hash function for the
encryption of the key. In order to protect the license key over the internet, the license key is passed to
the MD5 function, after the encryption the encrypted hash is returned to the Software application and
then the application transmits the hash to Authentication server and from there it goes to the API and
the API looks for the Hash (received from the client) into the database. The Server consist of a
database which keeps the list of all the License Keys and their corresponding MD5 hashes, moreover
these License keys are associated with a MAC address of the user who wants to register their
legitimate copy of the software application, therefore there are 2 Scenario :-
</p>
<p>
<b>Scenario 1</b>: The license key received by the API from the Client PC is present in the database but
there is a MAC address already registered with it. This means that the license key has already been
registered to a PC and the MAC address belongs to that PC in which it is registered. Therefore, the
API will not allow the client’s Application to register and if the registration fails, the installation on
the client side fails.

</p>


<p>
<b>Scenario 2</b>: The license key received by the API from the Client PC is not present in the database
and this means that the license key is fake. Note that all the license keys are already present in the server, and only those keys are genuine.

</p>

<p>
  <b>General Working</b>: The license key received by the API from the Client PC is present in the database and
  there is no MAC address associated with it. This means that the license key received is never been
  registered yet and it’s a new registration which should be allowed, and the API asks the client
  Application to give its MAC address to register it in the Database so that nobody else can use the
  same license key twice.

</p>

<p>
  <b>Offline Mode</b>: Now the software application is successfully installed, now internet connection is not required for the
  software to start, here the question arises that if anybody copied the installed software application
  and tried to run it on any other computer, then technically it should run on that pc because it has already
  been registered on the server, and now there is no restrictions left. Still the software application will run
  only on that system in which it was registered because every time the software boots up, the MAC
  address registered into the software application at the time of installation is checked with the current
  system’s MAC address. Therefore running that application on any other system will not work since
  every system have a unique MAC address.
